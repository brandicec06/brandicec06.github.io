			“Brandon Cuffy is an architectural designer at NBBJ and faculty at the Boston Architectural College. His work focuses on the synergies that exist between neuroscience and architectural design for the creation of healing spaces. His graduate thesis examined the current state of United States prisons and their degenerative effects on the neural activity of prisoners, and he speculated on the implications of the role architecture can play in the healing and rehabilitation process. He received his Bachelors of Science in Architecture from the University of Virginia, and earned his Masters of Architecture degree from the Harvard University Graduate School of Design.”
